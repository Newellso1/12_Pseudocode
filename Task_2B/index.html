    // --- Problem ---
    // Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!
    // Create a list of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a
    // string), and already read (a boolean (true/false) indicating if you read it yet).
    // Iterate (go through) through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: “The
    // Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien”.
    // Modify the output based on whether the book’s been read: if so, log a string like ‘You already read “The Hobbit” by
    // J.R.R. Tolkien’, and if not, log a string like ‘You still need to read “The Hobbit” by J.R.R. Tolkien.’

    // --- Solution ---
    // Create an Array that to hold book objects
    //Create objects in array
    // FOR to loop through the books and console log properties 
    // IF to decide if read or not


    // -- Code ---
